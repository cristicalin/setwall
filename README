This application is designed to work with appindicator (designed by Ubuntu) and
work best with Unity Desktop. To use the application with Gnome 3 desktop, you
need to install support for old application icons. One such example is this
extension: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/495/topicons/

Pre-requisite python modules:

Ubuntu
* apsheduler (python-apscheduler)
* urllib2 (part of main python)
* simplejson (python-simplejson)
* pyinotify (python-pyinotify)
* Keybinder (gir1.2-keybinder-3.0)
* Gtk3 bindings (gir1.2-gtk-3.0)

Fedora
* AppIndicator3 (libappindicator-gtk3)
* apsheduler (pip install apscheduler)
* urllib2 (part of main python)
* simplejson (part of main python)
* pyinotify (python-inotify)
* Keybinder (keybinder3-devel)
* Gtk3 bindings (gtk3-devel)

Installing the schema file, this is necessary for the gsettings to work:

$ sudo cp com.kman.wallpaper-changer.gschema.xml /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/
$ sudo chown root:root /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/com.kman.wallpaper-changer.gschema.xml
$ sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/

You can check by using gsettings command:

gsettings list-keys com.kman.wallpaper-changer

NOTE: there seems to be a X11 resource leak in Nautilus,
please make sure to disable the background-fade feature
as that seems to slow down the leak or even prevent it

gsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.desktop background-fade false
