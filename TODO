* figure out how to set specific file name in settings dialog
* speed up save and load on massive folders (30000+ images)
* implement file name filtering
* support decent fork()'ing on initial launch, there seems
  that DBus fails to connect after fork() leaving the application
  stuck in connecting to DBus and exiting with a timeout

DONE

* need to make the app into an object so it can be passed around
* implement preview functionality in the settings dialogue
* load new file list if folder selection changes in settings
