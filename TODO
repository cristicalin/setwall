This document contains a list of TODOs and ideas for setwall.
Done tasks/ideas are listed at the end of the document.

BUGS
* [FIXED] when closing windows using the X button on the window
  title bar the contents get mangled / objects get invalidated
* when disabling wallpaper save feature and clicking apply
  the list gets reset improperly
* [FIXED] UTF-8 encoding comparison in BST fails

TODO

* use python Keybinder to set global key bindings
* implement favorites feature: should support multiple lists
  and restrict slideshow to current favorite list
* support keyboard shortcut feature for next stop and previous
* figure out how to set specific file name in settings dialog
  would be nice to click in the status bar and have a dropdown
  list allow to select the file (maybe support preview in the
  dropdown list as well)
* implement file name filtering
* support decent fork()'ing on initial launch, there seems
  that DBus fails to connect after fork() leaving the application
  stuck in connecting to DBus and exiting with a timeout
* support other desktop environments (Gnome3, Mate, KDE, Xfce)

DONE

* need to make the app into an object so it can be passed around
* implement preview functionality in the settings dialogue
* load new file list if folder selection changes in settings
* separate dbus code into different class, keep application 
  class implementation simple
* separate Indicator / menu code into different class
* add favorites CLI support
* speed up save and load on massive folders (30000+ images)
* allow loading of previous list without reconciliation
  this speeds up loading with large folders (30000+ images)
* implement favorites management dialog, support list
  manipulation, saving and propagation
* implement a more balanced search optimized tree structure,
  when loading a list sort it first and use divide et impera
  to split into a balanced binary sort tree
